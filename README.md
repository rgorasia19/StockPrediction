# StockPrediction
A  Python project that uses machine learning (esp. LSTM/GRU models) to predict stock movements. It shows data fetching, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and forecasting in a tidy, modular design. Built as a Jupyter Notebook to showcase how to go from nothing to a full stock prediction program. This code is still under development, I just wanted to push it to git.

## Requirements
Python 3.8+

pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch

yfinance or alpha_vantage (or your preferred data source)

Optional: matplotlib/seaborn for plotting

## Models
Built-in support for:

LSTM – great for capturing temporal dependencies

GRU – lighter than LSTM, similar performance

Easily extendable to include RNN, Transformer, ARIMA, XGBoost, etc.
